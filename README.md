# CTI Stuffs

![CTI nerds vs threat actors](https://i.imgur.com/SP93Ph5.png)

A collection of CTI stuffs and various intel ðŸ“ƒ 

I was inspired to make this because corpo intel companies are straight up absurd and charge 5-6 figures a year just to access this same type of data. I aint paying for that shit and oftentimes those of us in CTI cant get the needed budget approved for the tools we need/want so here we are. This is an ever changing and evolving repo that should (in theory) be updated oftenish so that it has fresh data.

If you have any neat fresh data/intel to add, submit a PR and throw it up baw.

If you are a researcher or cybercriminal who found your username in these lists, you should enable in the forum Settings to hide yourself when online and/or disable your acct from displaying in the Who's Online sections publicly. Tons of nerds (like me) be scraping weird stuffs like this.
